                <h1>About</h1>    
                <p>My fascination with airplanes, airports, and airlines began as a small child.  Both of my parents were teachers.  As a result, my family could afford the annual summertime trip by plane to see </p>
                <p>my grandparents in the State of Texas.  It was a result of those trips that I caught "the bug".  Fast forward to my adulthood:  I've always considered myself lucky to have been employed in the industry that</p>
                <p>I absolutely loved.  The old saying is if you love what you do, it isn't work.  Such an apt idiom for me.  As such, I spent nearly 30 years in the airline industry, based primaily based at Los Angeles International Airport</p>
                <p>My professional roles included stints in administration, operations, and sales.  I also enjoyed brief stints at John Wayne Orange County Airport, as well as Ontario International Airport.</p>
    
                <p>As I'm now enjoying semi-retirement, I'm creating my next act - taking my passion for aviation and conbining it with my passion for reading.  My next act is Fly-paper Books & Magazines....an online bookstore that specializes in</p>
                <p>....yes, aviation.  You will find new & used books, and back issue magazines.  My thematic approach is primarily airline industry publication.</p>
